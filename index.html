                    <h3>Twenty feet underwater I took the regulator out of my mouth, and blew a stream of bubbles off the coast of San Nicholas Island.  As I did, the playful sea lion pup that had been nipping at my fins and swimming in circles around me turned face to face and blew a stream of bubbles in response.  The pup and 20 or so of his friends had splashed into the water upon hearing our anchor drop into the clear water just minutes before, as if to ring the bell “The divers are here!”.  That was the moment that I knew that I belong to the underwater world.<BR><BR></h3>

                    <h3>I had grown up on boats, and had been drawn by my curiosity for the natural world and science to a Bachelors degree in Biology at the University of Rhode Island, where I began diving, but it all gelled in that moment while working aboard the dive charter 'Horizon' in the Channel Islands.  Over the course of the season I collected and housed all of the common California marine species with San Diego schoolchildren for day-trips, bagged spiny lobsters by hand at Cortez Bank, and even dove with Great Whites off the coast of Mexico.  After finishing the season filling tanks, helping divers with their gear, and assisting with 3-4 dives a day I was ready for more, so I traveled to Roatan, Honduras to earn my Divemaster certification.  Here I perfected a vigilant awareness of surroundings and buoyancy underwater while leading dives on wrecks, through coral reefs, and along current swept walls that reached down to the abyss.<BR><BR></h3>

I earned a captains license, and traveled aboard through the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and Central America, jumping in the water every chance I could get, even if only to scrub the bottom.  The  most satisfying experiences were always while helping guests interact with and gain a better appreciation of the underwater world.<BR><BR></h3>
